## About

I predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX
advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62
million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each,
much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can
determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an
alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
